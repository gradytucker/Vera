# Vera - a secure digital fabric for smart city living and modern digital needs

## UN World Innovation Day Hackathon 2022
- Challenge 2 - Blockchain for good is the targeted theme.
- We have aligned our solution with the UN's Sustainable Development Goal #9 - build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrilization, and foster innovation.

## Architecture
- IPFS hosted frontend built with React.js, web3.js, and Metamask connectivity.
- Solidity-based smart contract deployed on Polygon testnet.

## Pitch
- Vera is a blockchain protocol created to allow users to securely store and access their data on-chain for day-to-day smart city needs such as healthcare, transportation, bank accounts, etc., in a ubiquitous manner through smart devices. Vera accomplishes this while preserving the least exposure principle and full privacy.

- Public services infrastructure and officers can easily onboard to interact with Vera users in a privacy-preserving fashion through ZKP, and as such the potential for Vera as the digital fabric of the future is endless as a scalabe, environmentaly-friendly, universally applicable means of enabling digital applications while maintaining user privacy and compliance.
