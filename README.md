# Vera - a secure digital fabric for smart city living and modern digital needs

## UN World Innovation Day Hackathon
- Blockchain for good is the targeted theme.

## Architecture
- IPFS hosted frontend built with React.js, web3.js, and metamask connectivity
- Solidity-based smart contract deployed on Polygon testnet.

## Pitch
- We are creating a protocol that will ideally be interwoven with everyone's digital lives in smart cities. A protocol that is scalable, exceptionally secure, and completely privacy preserving.

- This protocol will allow ubiquitous access to real life functionality and data such as pharmacy scripts, taxes, insurance, identification, transport, welfare, police checks and records, COVID vaccination reports, etc. while preserving the least exposure principle and full privacy.
